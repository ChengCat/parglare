There is no separate lexer grammar.\nThe parser will try to reconize token during parsing at the given location.\nThis brings more parsing power as there are no lexical ambiguities\nintroduced by a separate lexing stage. You want variable names in your\nlanguage to be allowed to be keyword names? No problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized parsing - GLR\n\n\nparglare gives you powerful tools to see where non-determinism in your\ngrammar lies (the notorious shift-reduce and reduce-reduce conflicts) and\ngives detailed info on why that happened. In case your language needs\nnon-deterministic parsing, either it needs additional lookahead to decide or\nyour language is inherently ambiguous, you can resort to the GLR algorithm\nby a simple change of the parser class. The grammar stays the same.\n\n\nIn the case of non-determinism (unability for a parser to deterministically\ndecide what to do) the parser will fork and investigate each possibility.\nEventualy, parsers that decided wrong will die leaving only the right one.\nIn case there are multiple interpretation of your input you will get all the\ntrees (a.k.a. \"the parse forest\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclarative associativity and priority rules\n\n\nThese problems arise a lot when building expression languages. Even a little\narithmetic expression as \n3 + 4 * 5 * 2\n have multiple interpretation\ndepending on the associativity and priority of operations. In parglare it is\neasy to specify these rules in the grammar (see the quick intro bellow\nor\n\nthe calc example\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracing/debuging, visualization and error reporting\n\n\nThere is an extensive support for grammar checking, debugging, automata\nvisualization, and parse tracing. Check out \ntodo: pglr command\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParsing arbitrary list of object\n\n\nparglare is not used only to parse the textual content. It can parse (create\na tree) of an arbitrary list of objects (numbers, bytes, whatever) based on\nthe common parglare grammar. For this you have to\ndefine \ntodo: token recognizers\n for your input stream. The built-in\nrecognizers are string and regex recognizers for parsing textual inputs.\nSee \nrecognizers\n parameter to grammar construction in\nthe \ntest_parse_list_of_objects.py test\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexible actions calling strategies\n\n\nDuring parsing you will want to do something when the grammar rule matches.\nThe whole point of parsing is that you want to transform your input to some\noutput. There are several options:\n- do nothing - this way your parser is a mere recognizer, it produces\n  nothing but just verifies that your input adhere to the grammar;\n- call default actions - the default actions will build a parse tree.\n- call user supplied actions - you write a Python function that is called\n  when the rule matches. You can do whatever you want at this place and the\n  result returned is used in parent rules/actions.\n\n\nBesides calling your actions in-line - during the parsing process - you can\ndecide to build the tree first and call custom actions afterwards. This is a\ngood option if you want to evaluate your tree in a multiple ways or if you\nare using GLR and want to be sure that actions are called only for the\nsurviving tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for whitespaces/comments\n\n\nSupport for language comments/whitespaces is done using the special rule\n\nLAYOUT\n. By default whitespaces are skipped. This is controlled by \nws\n\nparameter to the parser constructor which is by default set to \n\\t\\n\n. If\nset to \nNone\n no whitespace skipping is provided. If there is a rule\n\nLAYOUT\n in the grammar this rule is used instead. An additional parser with\nthe layout grammar will be built to handle whitespaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError recovery (not for GLR at the moment)\n\n\nThis is something that often lacks in parsing libraries. More often than not\nyou will want your parser to recover from an error, report it, and continue\nparsing. parglare has a built-in error recovery strategy which is currently\na simplistic one - it will skip current character and try to continue - but\ngives you possibility to provide your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest coverage\n\n\nTest coverage is high and I'll try to keep it that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO/Planed\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocs\n\n\nThis docs is currently work in progress. It should be done soon. Stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable caching\n\n\nAt the moment parser tables are constructed on-the-fly which might be slow\nfor larger grammars. In the future tables will be recalculated only if the\ngrammar has changed and cached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecify common actions in the grammar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparglare provides some commonly used custom actions. It would reduce\n  boiler-plate in specification of these actions if a syntax is added to provide\n  that information in the grammar directly.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n  @collect\n  some_objects = some_objects some_object | some_object;\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for named matches\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, as a parameter to action you get a list of matched elements. It\n  would be useful to reference these element by name rather than by position.\n\n\n  my_rule = first:first_match_rule second:second_match_rule;\n  first_match_rule = ...;\n  second_match_rule = ...;\n\n\n\nNow in your action for \nmy_rule\n you will get \nfirst\n and \nsecond\n as a parameters.\n  This would make it easy to provide a new common action that will return a Python\n  object with supplied parameters as object attributes.\n\n\nQuick intro\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis is just a small example to get the general idea. This example shows how to\nparse and evaluate expressions with 5 operations with different priority and\nassociativity.

Clone your fork locally:  bash\n  $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/parglare.git    Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have\n   virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local\n   development:  bash\n$ mkvirtualenv parglare\n$ cd parglare/\n$ python setup.py develop    Create a branch for local development::  bash\n  $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature    Now you can make your changes locally.    When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the\n   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:  bash\n$ flake8 parglare tests\n$ python setup.py test or py.test\n$ tox    To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.    Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:  bash\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\"\n$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature    Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.",
